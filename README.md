## Notes on improvement

### Module 1

Lesson plan for lecture could be more explicit?

Add solutions to exercises in folds

### Module 2



### Module 3

Week 2 slides need more structure: very listy. Also, TMI. Didn't get to overdispersion & rushed residuals.

Proof of asymptotic distribution: a bit of a mess. Should probably do as a video.
